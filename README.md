# NBAproject

Welcome to the NBA Project. Here I present a Visualization Dashboard with insights into basketball players and team statistics. The project is implemented using SQL, Python, and Streamlit.

This repository has code for a Streamlit dashboard that connects to a MySQL database, retrieves NBA statistics data, and presents it through interactive visualizations. The project is designed to provide users with a user-friendly interface to explore various aspects of NBA player and team performance.

Features:
- Connects to a MySQL database and retrieves NBA statistics data.
- Calculates and visualizes average height per position, player experience, rebounds, turnovers, lead changes, and points.
- Presents data using Matplotlib-based bar charts within a Streamlit dashboard.
- Allows users to interactively select and view different visualizations.
- Provides insights into player and team performance trends.
